# Weather Web Application

I have built this web application using just `React` framework. You can search any place and you will get the information reagrding the Weather, Temparature, UV, Wind, Wind direction, Heat Index and many more.

### Just follow below steps to run the project.

1. Make sure that you have `Node Js` installed on your system. If not kindly download it from [HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)

2. You need to have the `API KEY` to make requests for the data. So you have to create the account on [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/), and from there you have to get you API key and paste it in `WeatherContextProvider` file exactly at the line number 40.

3. You need to create one more account on [Open Cage](https://opencagedata.com/) and from there also you have to get `API KEY` and paste it in `WeatherContextProvider` file exactly at the line number 40.

4. Open the **Terminal** and make sure that the path should end with `/frontend`

5. Run this line `npm install`, it will install all the nexessary packages.

6. Run this line `npm run dev`

7. That's it.
